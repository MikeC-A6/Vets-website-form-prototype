**SPRUCE Team Working Agreement**

Team calendar is pinned in our slack channel. Standup is at 11am Eastern daily!

**Shared Values and Actions**

*   We are biased towards action! 
*   Use hand raise function in zoom during meetings to keep our meetings orderly and ensure everyone has a chance to speak.
*   Ensure each meeting has a purpose and objective. If you need a notetaker please ask for one.
*   There are no dumb questions- we ask each other for the information we need.
*   We are all valuable contributors and treat each other with the kindness and respect we’d like to be treated with.
*   By taking care of myself, I take care of my team.
*   We will flag risks to the challenge as soon as they are found. By doing so, we will contribute to the success of the team.
*   Having a camera on is not an indicator of engagement. If you need to multitask or step away during meetings or synchronous work, please let your teammates know verbally or in the zoom chat.
*   Seek help and offer help
*   Demo early and demo often



**Communication Plan**

*   Default to open in our slack channel when possible.
*   Use threads when possible in Slack.
*   When creating an impromptu working session/meeting, add the link in slack in case anyone would like to join that wasn’t immediately invited
*   Capture decisions in the decision log as soon as they’re made. Even if decisions seem trivial, please add them and they can be taken out later if needed.
*   When requesting a PR, please post the link in slack and ping the requested reviewers. It is helpful to add specific direction around what needs review/open questions and estimated duration to review.

    

**Definition of Done (for individual tasks)**

*   Unit tests written (if applicable. Aim for 80-100% code coverage)
*   Acceptance criteria met and signed off by PO
*   Review of pull requests (“LGTM” from team member(s))
*   Artifacts completed and placed in shared code challenge folder in drive (for design/research)
*   If the artifact can’t be stored in drive, a link should be included in the ticket and/or PR
*   Ultimately the artifact should be converted to PDF and added to drive
*   Key decisions that were made are documented
