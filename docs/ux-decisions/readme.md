| ------------------- | ----------  | 
| DD-214 does not contain relevant data for all service periods for a Veteran. For example, it only contains their duty assignment and major command for that service period. Veteran research indicated that each service period's forms would be readily available for some Veterans, but not all.<br/><br/> | Hint text was not working for these form fields in the VA Form Library, otherwise our implementation would have used the hint text fields to help Veterans understand what type or format of information is needed for the duty assignment and major command fields, and potentially reference that having their DD-214 documents would make filling out this information easier.<br/><br/> |
| Our research from Veterans indicated that it wasn't clear which service periods they would be receiving a frame for.<br/><br/> | Our recommendation for this form would be to include information on the Service Periods page to let Veterans know that their last service period would be used when creating the certificate and frame, as well as reinforced on the Choose Your Frame page. I.e., if that assumption were to be correct.<br/><br/> |
| Having unique h1s per page, especially for assistive technology (AT) users. I.e., the VA Form Library and its components would not enable us to easily change where the h1 is set.<br/><br/> | The team decided to not implement unique h1s even though it's a known accessibility issue. It would have required a rewrite of the VA Forms library to explore using h1s inside the <legend> element and using fieldsets. In addition, this would allow the focus target to be contextually relevant to the page the user is on. Reference: [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels).<br/><br/> |
| The form uses chapters with steps (using the progress bar - segmented component), even though the component supports up to thirteen segments. This caused some initial confusion to Veterans, but did not stop them from completing the form. Overall, Veterans thought the form was simple and easy to use.<br/><br/> | We used chapters with steps on the progress bar even though [our Veteran research](https://github.com/agilesix/vets-website/tree/main/docs/research) shows more steps can be confusing. However, [VA documentation exists](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/2688) in the VA Design System indicating the progress bar - segmented component should be iterated on to communicate steps within chapters. We decided not to take this on, but leave it for future iterations.<br/><br/> |
| Alerting the Veteran inline, during the step, that their new mailing address has been saved.<br/><br/> | We wanted to avoid scenarios that required stacked alerts. E.g., too much noise for Veterans. In a future iteration, we would implement a separate page for saving the Veteran's new mailing address to their profile. E.g., a page immediately following address verification that would ask the Veteran if they'd want to save the selected address as their mailing address for VA letters, bills, and prescriptions, and if selected, show an inline success alert.<br/><br/> |
| If Veteran wanted to save their selected address as their new mailing address, include this information in the Review page.<br/><br/> | This was deemed to be difficult to accomplish using the VA Forms Library. Instead, we decided to include an additional success alert on the Confirmation page.<br/><br/> |
| Communicate to Veterans that either SSN or DoD ID is required.<br/><br/> | We decided to include text that addressed this concern, but in a future iteration we would also change these fields to use the radio button component that allows single input.<br/><br/> |
| Instructions in the code challenge were unclear on the form's eligibility requirements.<br/><br/> | We decided not to include eligibility requirements using the summary box component because the requirements were not clear. However, we would have used this component on the Introduction page if we felt confident in what was provided.<br/><br/> |
