# Research Plan - Discharge Certificate Frame Form Usability & A11y Testing 


## Background  

The Veteran Widget Office (VWO) is responsible for building and running various digital products that help VA business lines deliver on their missions. In response to recent legislation, the VWO has been tasked with creating a new digital experience for Veterans in the context of the VA.gov website. Today, VA.gov provides dozens of self-service transactions, including digital forms that allow Veterans to apply for and enroll in specific VA benefits.

The new legislation allows Veterans to receive a complementary frame for their DD-217 Discharge Certificate. To receive the benefit, Veterans must login to their VA.gov account and complete VA Form 24-SPRUCE.

### Personas

This research aligns with the following Veteran personas: 

VA Form 24-SPRUCE Peronas

## Research goals 

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the Discharge Certificate Frame Form (VA Form 24-SPRUCE) prototype and develop a better understanding of Veteransâ€™ mental model around discharge papers, including ceremonial documents such as the DD-217. 

### Research questions

Background: What background or scaffolding do Veterans need to motivate them to complete the form? How much explanation of the new feature is needed to get started?
Usability: Are Veterans able to easily complete the form with little to no confusion?
How easily are Veterans able to choose a shipping address?
Are Veterans able to easily modify prefilled service history data?
Ease of use: Do Veterans have any concerns about the data required to complete the form?

## Methodology

This research will be conducted as a moderated study using Zoom. After some initial questions around service history and use of VA.gov, we will have participants navigate through a Figma prototype or the application (remotely from one of the challenge participants' machines). The moderator will then ask follow-on questions related to overall ease of use and opportunities for improvement.
