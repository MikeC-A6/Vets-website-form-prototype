# Conversation Guide - Discharge Certificate Frame Form Usability Study - Round 1  

## Starting the Session 

- Sign in to Zoom.
- Create thread in #prop-spruce-challenge-working.
- Add observer instructions into the thread.
- Open up [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/YPy7EusTFLgZOWCs0VKjJB/DD-217-discharge-certificate-frame?page-id=6%3A66&node-id=18-2599&viewport=604%2C343%2C0.2&t=UrxBCkXkJqXMvAp9-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=18%3A2599&show-proto-sidebar=1) in web browser.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Check to see if recording is set to save in the cloud.
- In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.
- In the Share menu, make sure all participants can share their screen.
- Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session.

### Observer instructions 

- If there is a Zoom waiting room, wait in the Zoom waiting room until the participant agrees you may join and the moderator lets you into the session.
- Do not change your name to “Observer.”
- Enter with your mic muted and video on - and be prepared to give a quick introduction. For example, “Hi, my name is [First name] and I’m a [role] for Agile Six.”
- Please do not use the Zoom chat - post questions and comments for the moderator in #prop-spruce-challenge-working Slack channel.
- Prepare your top 3 takeaways at the end of the session:
     - these are the top three items we should not forget or surprises in each session
     - write these in the #prop-spruce-challenge-working Slack thread for the session or in the [Lucid board observer notes](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/72ff475d-2807-464f-aad2-07d69f9c1fcb/edit?invitationId=inv_04c20fd3-05bb-4a6d-b0b7-6a3ae375b204&page=0_0#)

## Intro - 2 minutes 

- Hello and thank you for joining today. My name is [FIRST NAME]. How are you doing today? 

- Great. I wanted to quickly let you know that I have a colleague with me in this session who will be helping me to take notes.

- So, today, I'm going to ask you to do some specific tasks using a prototype that I will share with you in just a few moments. 

- But, before we start, I want to go over a few things: 

- First, I have some other colleagues [here] or [in the waiting room] who would like to observe and take notes. Are you comfortable with observers for this session? If not, please let me know.  
     - If “no,” ask the observers to leave Zoom via Slack. 
     - If “yes,” let other observers into the room. 
          - And, here are my colleagues. Team, please unmute your camera and microphone and quickly introduce yourself with your first name and role.
          - And now for my colleagues who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth and mute your audio, that would be great. Thank you.  

- So, this session today should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. 

- And, in this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We’re testing a prototype to learn how we can make it easier to use for Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback and I won’t be offended by opinions you express. 

- If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, please just let me know. 

- And, lastly, are you comfortable if I record this session today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but the recordings are deleted after we complete our analysis. Also, none of your comments will ever be attributed to you directly. So, is it okay to record this session? 

- Great. Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Okay, I’m going to start the recording now.   

- Okay, I have started recording. Once again, are you comfortable if I record this session today? 

- Great. Thank you. 

## Warm-Up Questions - 2 Minutes

- So, before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

- What device are you using to join this session today?

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the url? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.   

- And, are you separated from the military as of today? 

- And, have you received some or all of your discharge documents? 

- And, do you have an account on VA.gov? If so, when was the last time you signed in using your account?

- Great. Thank you. 

## Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes

- Now, I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today? 

- Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now. 

- So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.  

- Please tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen. In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options. And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.   

- Then, tap (or select) "Screen." Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.” Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen." 

- Perfect. 

## Usability Tasks

### Information Architecture - 2 Minutes    

- So, now we’ll review the prototype. And, the prototype that we’ll be reviewing today is for ordering a complementary frame to display a discharge certificate. And, specifically, we’ll be reviewing the step for selecting a shipping address to receive the frame. 

- In the prototype, some things you’ll be able to select, while other things you won’t. None of your information is included, and this won’t affect your account or benefits in any way.

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Great. In addition, I’m going to be starting and stopping you to provide specific instructions or ask you questions along the way. Does that sound okay?  

- Great. So, typically the first step of the process of ordering a complementary frame for a discharge certificate is to sign in to VA.gov. However, before we get to that, could you tell me how you might expect to be notified about this benefit? 

- And, pretending that you visited VA.gov, what section of the website or group of information would you expect to navigate to in order to locate it? 

### Usability Tasks - 20 Minutes   

- So, what I’d like to do now is send you the prototype link. 

- And, go ahead and select the link. 

_Veteran should be on the Tell Us Where to Mail page._

- Now, on this page, I’d like for you to review the information on the screen, and as you’re reviewing, I would like you to talk aloud as much as possible so that you share what you’re thinking about and what, if anything, you’re unsure about before advancing to the next page. So, please start reviewing the information on the screen, but remember, don’t advance to the next page yet.

## Post-Tasks Questions - 1 Minute

- Now, I have just a few follow up questions for you about the prototype that you reviewed today. And, remember, we only reviewed part of the process for ordering a complementary frame to display a discharge certificate. 

- So, overall, how easy or difficult has it been to complete this step of the process? And, why?

- And, overall, has there been any information or any step that’s been unclear?  

- And, overall, has there been anything that you would change or add about this process to make it easier?
