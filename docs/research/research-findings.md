# Research Findings - Discharge Certificate Frame Form Usability & A11y Testing

**Veteran Widget Office (VWO), VA Form 24-SPRUCE, Agile Six**

Date: 2024-06

## Research goals

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the Discharge Certificate Frame Form (VA Form 24-SPRUCE) prototype and develop a better understanding of Veteransâ€™ mental model around discharge papers, including ceremonial documents such as the DD-217. 

### Research questions

- **Background:** What background or scaffolding do Veterans need to motivate them to complete the form? How much explanation of the new feature is needed to get started?
- **Usability:** Are Veterans able to easily complete the form with little to no confusion?
     - How easily are Veterans able to choose a shipping address?
     - Are Veterans able to easily modify prefilled service history data?
- **Ease of use:** Do Veterans have any concerns about the data required to complete the form?

## Key findings

- Overall, form flow was simple, very easy to complete, and would be even easier when Veteran's information is prefilled
- Veterans liked the visual cues of the progress bar - segmented component, but had initial confusion when multiple pages represented one segment
- Provide specific examples on what impact "save to VA Profile" would have on Veterans. E.g., receiving information about benefits, prescriptions, payments, etc.
- Some Veterans were familiar with their DD-217 and preferred to have it referenced in the form flow, while others preferred more plain language, such as "honorable discharge certificate." E.g., having their DD-217 or DD-217 documents would make filling out the form easier.
- Veterans were confused on the term "verified" when paired with their mailing address. E.g., who has done the verification?
- Veterans did not know what information the service history fields were looking for. E.g., what is duty assignment and major command referring to?
- Veterans weren't immediately clear if they'd be receiving the same frame selection for each service period that was added.

## Recommendations

- Keep the progress bar - segmented component as is, with chapters and steps, knowing that Veterans thought the form flow was simple and easy after any initial confusion about what step of the form they were on. Having each page of the form represent a segment could have a negative impact on Veterans with cognitive disabilities, especially when using mobile devices. 
- Make it very clear to Veterans using hint text, citing specific examples, what "save to VA Profile" means. If needed, remind them multiple times.
- Make sure that the combination of the form title and form name includes both plain language and reference to DD-217. E.g., following [VA Forms Introduction guidance](https://design.va.gov/templates/forms/introduction#title).
- If time permits, utilize known VA patterns to help Veterans with confirming their mailing address. E.g., using the [VA address confirmation pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/addresses#address-confirmation). 
- Be clear and helpful by using hint text to break down complex information into simple, easy to understand, and not be overwhelming. E.g., using hint text to help Veterans understand what type or format of information is needed for the duty assignment and major command fields.
- Make it clear to Veterans that they're ordering a frame for their last service period, even though they might have or have provided multiple service periods.
